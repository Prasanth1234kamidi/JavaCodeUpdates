# Pattern Matching Enhanced (Java 17)

Pattern matching allows testing if an object has a particular structure and extracting data from it in a single operation.

## Why Pattern Matching?
- Reduces boilerplate instanceof checks
- Combines testing and casting in one step
- More readable and maintainable code
- Better integration with sealed classes and records

## Key Benefits
- Cleaner code structure
- Reduced casting errors
- Enhanced switch expressions
- Better type safety
