# Pattern Matching Enhanced (Java 17 vs Java 21+)

Pattern matching allows testing if an object has a particular structure and extracting data from it in a single operation.

## Java 17 Features
- Pattern matching for instanceof (finalized)
- Type patterns with pattern variables
- Eliminates explicit casting

## Java 21+ Features (Preview/Future)
- Pattern matching for switch statements
- Guard conditions with 'when' keyword
- Deconstruction patterns for records
- Array patterns and nested patterns

## Key Benefits
- Cleaner code structure
- Reduced casting errors
- Enhanced switch expressions
- Better type safety
- More expressive conditional logic
