# Sealed Classes (Finalized in Java 17)

Sealed classes restrict which classes can extend or implement them, providing more control over inheritance hierarchies.

## Why Sealed Classes?
- Controlled inheritance hierarchy
- Better pattern matching support
- Domain modeling with restricted subtypes
- Compile-time exhaustiveness checking

## Key Benefits
- Enhanced security and encapsulation
- Better API design
- Improved pattern matching
- Clearer intent in code
