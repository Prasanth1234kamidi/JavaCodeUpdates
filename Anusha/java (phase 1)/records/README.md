# Records (Finalized in Java 17)

Records provide a compact syntax for declaring classes that are transparent holders for shallowly immutable data.

## Why Records?
- Eliminates boilerplate code for data classes
- Automatic generation of constructor, getters, equals(), hashCode(), toString()
- Immutable by default
- Clear intent for data-only classes

## Key Benefits
- Reduced code verbosity
- Better readability
- Compile-time safety
- Pattern matching support
